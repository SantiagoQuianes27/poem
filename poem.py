print("""In whispered woods where sunlight weaves,
A tapestry of golden leaves,
Each rustling branch, a gentle song,
Where nature's heart beats strong and long.

The mountains rise in majesty,
Their peaks a kiss of mystery,
With rivers carving paths below,
A dance of water, swift and slow.

In fields of wildflowersâ€™ embrace,
Colors collide in a vibrant race,
Bees hum softly, a busy choir,
While breezes carry the scent of fire.""")
